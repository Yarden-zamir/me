Working to make a pattern of living that's sustainable and pushes me forward. based on my [[Protocol]] system.
 
# Projects
- Working on the things I care about
	- [[Create.run]]
	- [[DiscordGithub-Bridge]]
	- [[Workflow v4]]
	- etc...
- Dedicating time, but **not too much time!**
- Making sure to take notes and document as much as possible, whether it be in [[Github]] or [[Obsidian.md]] 

# Social
Even though I want to code/consume media all day, I should start interacting more as it **makes me feel better** almost always

# Meditation
Adopt some form of [[Meditation]] as it's universally regarded as a really **useful tool**.

# Nutrition
Trying out [[Keto]] again in some form or another because last time I was under it was a really good time overall
[[Cooking]] for myself
	- And others

# Physical Activity
- Figure out a simple way to work out
 - Biking
 - ~~Running~~
 - Push-ups
- Time
 - Before work (If I wake up early. [[Protocol PEAK/Sleep|Sleep]])
 - After work
 - Because of my new arrangement with [[Oria beker]] I have time between 12:00 and 1:15, that would work perfectly for a workout

# Reading
Read and **take notes on anything**, preferably a book

# Writing
Using [[Workflow v4]]
Pushing myself to **reflect** and plan my life
**Getting a grip** of what is going on to me and around me
I want to write one writeup per week, up to a point that it can be publicly posted
# Sleep
Sleep no more than 8 hours, no less than 7.
Try to go to sleep at 22:00 / 22:30 and wake up at around 6:00
# Listen
Make sure to listen to myself, the rules here are **malleable**
I'm not supposed to suffer, I'm supposed to **develop**
