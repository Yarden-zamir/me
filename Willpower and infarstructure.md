To do things I usually take the view of [[Action Potential Model|Action Potential]] to visualize what drives and prevents me from doing things, which then reduces things into either "lets increase value of something" or "lets decrease friction of something" because in both cases I will find said thing easier to undertake.

Lets now focus on the latter, reducing friction is often the most effective and the least used way to manipulate the Action Potential for a given task. Something has low friction when it is easy, quick, simple, when its free, when it's automatic, etc. Those things happen when we are very strong and able, lifting things, running somewhere, are free when we are strong, are easy when we are quick. Building things and fixing things is easier when we are experts and overcoming emotional turmoil is easier when we have the tools and skills to do so. In addition to that, there is another way to reduce friction without being better at said task, without having relavent knowledge or skills and without necessarily being strong, that way is called willpower.

Willpower is the ability to push and do something despite it's difficulty, despite it's initial friction, it's the ability to stomach difficulties and pain, usually in the short term to be able to get more things done. The ability to study 12 hours straight because you will fail the test otherwise (of course this is affected by the value of succeeding and the negative value of failing but aside from those the ability to push through the obvious extreme difficulty in cases like those will be your will)

Having a strong willpower is like a superpower, it's a trumpcard you can use anywhere, you can expand it as fuel to build and achieve, to overcome and challenge, and to push through the most difficult things. It's the ability to become a monstertruck and climb through rocky mountains and thick jungles. A powerful general purpose tool.

Willpower is like a huge ass 4x4 truck making its way in a jungle, amazingly strong, steamrolling its way forward and achieving incredible feats. On the other end of the spectrum there is a crummy, old transit track with gasping engine making its way on the main road. The transit will almost always travel farther than the 4x4, it will expand less energy and do more.
