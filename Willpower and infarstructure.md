Willpower is like a huge ass 4x4 truck making its way in a jungle, amazingly strong, steamrolling its way forward and achieving incredible feats. On the other end of the spectrum there is a crummy, old transit track with gasping engine making its way on the main road. The transit will almost always travel farther than the 4x4, it will expand less energy and do more.
