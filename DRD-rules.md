*Resolution mechanics*	
Any task has it’s *🛡️ Resolution Class* to succeed in the task you need to surpass it with your *💪 Resolution Ability* or add the result of a *🎲 Resolution Dice* - a 2d4 roll

Risk and strain
Some actions are risky, requiring a *⚠️ Risk Dice* a d8 roll where 1 leads to harm of self and 8 leads to collateral damage. Any form of harm to the character is loosely represented by *☠️ Strain*. Some things are always risky, like energy usage in *🧙 Casting* 

Drama Tokens and Legendary Acts
*🗣️ Drama Tokens* are earned through dramatic, awesome actions. These can be used to add a d4 to any resolution including ones that don’t require resolution dice like *🧙 Casting*. 🦸 Legendary Acts are awarded by the whole table to characters that did something completely legendary and have a state alter related to said act











*🛡️ Resolution Class*
Ranks the difficulty of a task
Unaffected by the person undertaking the task.
*💪 Resolution Ability*
A bonus or a penalty from expertise, equipment or circumstance that determines success in completing tasks.
A higher Resolution Ability  secures automatic successes if it surpasses the Resolution Class
*🎲 Resolution Dice* 
A 2d4 roll that is added to the Resolution Ability to determine outcome.
*⚠️ Risk Dice* 
A d8 roll determining the potential negative consequences of dangerous or reckless actions.
Outcomes can be *harm to self (1) to collateral damage (8) or safe (2-7)*
One can choose to take a reckless action to add 2 to Resolution Ability
*☠️ Strain*
Indicates fatigue, stress, injury but also karma, luck and plot armor.
Levels of 4 or 5 result in incapacitation or complete loss of the character, respectively.
*🗣️ Drama Tokens*
Group resources earned through dramatic, awesome actions. These can be used to add a d4 to any resolution including ones that don’t require resolution dice like casting
*🧙 Casting* 
High-risk, high-reward, powerful and unique abilities 
Based on cast chart, see the resolution class of the desired action. Surpass it with Resolution Ability or consume energy to increase it while increasing risk
🔋Energy
Continues energy can be generated from your own muscle, adding 3 Resolution Ability, and one Risk Dice
Combustible energy can be generated by consuming sugar of any kind
🦸 Legendary Acts
At the end of a session, with a discussion amongst the players and the DM, at least one character gets a legendary act due to an awesome action they did during the session. (this system’s equivalent of level up)
A legendary act can be anything from a bonus, a cast, etc.





*🧙 Casting*
Any living entity (and some inanimate) have a pool of energy inside them that may contain combustible or continuous energy. For most, having the pool contain anything actively is a risk that grows as time goes on. Anyone can charge their own pool with continues energy using their own muscles or with combustible energy by consuming simple carbohydrates (common source is ash)

Combustible energy - Use immediately on cast
Continues energy - Used while the spell is maintained, requires concentration, meaning that if you get hit, you might lose the cast

When casting, add the *🛡️ Resolution Class*
 (RC) from each category together, that’s your total RC, you need to surpass it with your *💪 Resolution Ability*. To do so, you may need to consume energy.

Example : to use Calida’s Thermic Touch to make my 10 foot rope conductive, my mass will be 2Rc as it’s heavier than a coin but no heavier than a rock. And my Conductivity change will be 3Rc, as I want it to be conductive but it doesn’t need to be extremely so. Together that means I need 5Rc. My base resolution ability is 3, so to reach 5 I need to use my muscles to generate continuous energy, even though it’s risky. So my cast succeeds, and I throw a Risk Dice to see if there are negative consequences Note, casting does not involve dice unless using a Drama Token



*Abilities*
Abilities represent the character's ableness to deal with any situation. When a situation requires resolution, the player will usually add one or two relevant Abilities to their Resolution Ability (can add the same one twice)

*👁️‍🗨️ Sense* - alertness, perception, vision, hearing, touch, attentiveness
*👥 Social* - diplomacy, etiquette, leadership, intimidation, persuasion, seduction, social ques
*💪 Physical* - strength, endurance, agility, dexterity, speed, balance
*🛠️ Mechanical* - engineering, repairng, solving mechanical problems, building, crafting
*🧙 Casting* - casting spells/casts, using magic, channeling energy, using magical items























DRD changelog 
0.2
Resolution dice is no longer a d6, it’s now 2d4.
When two or more risk dice are used, failure is catastrophic 
Resolution ability is now added multiple times based on applicability of ability on resolution. Base is twice.
Enemies no longer throw dice in battle, each enemy has their RC (resolution score) base, then based on the abilities they use and their situation, up to 3 is added or subtracted
When casting, can no longer add resolution dice, 
When casting, risk dice is no longer required for the spell, but is required when using up energy.
When casting, resolution score is resolution ability + energy
Using 15kg of muscle energy, adds 3 to resolution score + 1 risk dice
Using ash adds 3 to resolution score + 1 risk dice
Using external energy can go higher
When throwing risk for energy usage, harm to self means harm to caster, collateral means harm to pool/source (can also be caster)
0.3
A new ability called “Sense” which will be responsible for alertness, perception, vision, hearing, touch, attentiveness, etc.
Drama tokens are no longer used as narrative injectors, instead they are used to add a d4 to any resolution including ones that don’t require resolution dice like casting
Narrative injectors are now loosely limited to one per player per session 
Continues energy usage is no longer rigidly tied to 15kg of energy, it’s now a more loose connection to strength
Carrying ash is no longer trivial, the vials are heavy and big, cannot carry more than roughly ten of them on your person or fifteen if you have a pack, without some careful management and creative solutions
