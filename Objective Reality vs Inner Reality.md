We start constructing our inner world or inner reality very early in life, and a bit later we find out that it is different from the reality others precive.  
Our [[Social]] environment 

We are more comfortable when the reality outside reflects the one inside, which is not always the case. To prevent the pain that comes from the mismatch we are to do one of two things. Altar the environment, the world around us; by moving to a different place creating and breaking relationships and building things. We can also altar our inner world, a compromise, we accept that right now the AC is on and we don't ask for it to be turned off, even though it conflicts with what we want, our inner world of needs.
