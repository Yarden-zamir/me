[[Markus Aurelius]] used the term "sovereignty of the mind". In this writeup I will push this concept the way I perceive it.  
My theory and outlook on life

## Preface
I am writing not to teach or expose something new, but to assemble language and tools for something we all already posses. Treat this as a convoluted dictionary before a treating it as a guide.

## Core

### [[Human biological evolution vs societal evolution]]

### [[Why we should have control over our minds]]

### [[Action Potential Model]]

### [[Alignment of Interest]]

### [[Secret/Mans Violent Nature]]

### [[Problematic elasticity]]

### [[From The Ground Up|From the Ground Up]]
