## Core
The core of my life, the thing I will be focusing on in this protocol is work/life balance

---

## Work
I will put as much effort as I can into my [[Job/Software Engineer at Qlik|Job at Qlik]] and try to be the best I can be, but when I'm off hours I'll let myself have time to unwind and relax

## Nutrition
I don't want to keep doing [[Keto]] even though I'm convinced it gave me a lot and would give me a lot if I were to continue, I want to do something less strict but also get some of the benefits I had in keto, my thoughts were around [[Time Restricted Feeding]] plus [[Low Carb Diet]] which coupled with my acquired keto adaptiveness hopefully will keep me in ketosis for much of the day

## Physical Activity
- I will [[Bike]] to [[Qlik|Work]]
- I will start [[Climbing]] again
- I will start [[Yoga]]

## Writing
Using [[Workflow implementation using Digital Mindfield|My digital mindfield]] I will push myself to develop a healthy writing habit
I also want to do write-ups so many start a [[Blog]]

## Meditation
Adopt some form of [[Meditation]] as it's universally regarded as a really **useful tool**.
protocols

## Sleep
Sleep no more than 8 hours, no less than 7.
Try to go to sleep at 22:00 / 22:30 and wake up at around 6:00

## Listen
Make sure to listen to myself, the rules here are **malleable**
I'm not supposed to suffer, I'm supposed to **develop**
