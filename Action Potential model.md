`Action Potential = Precivied Value / Friction`

# Why We Do What We Do - a Model
At any given time, for any given action, we calculate...

# Functional Use - How to Do Things
Sometimes there is something we dearly want to do but find ourselves again and again avoiding. To change that we need to take a look at the evaluation that our brains go though when avoiding such activities `Action Potential = Perceived Value / Friction` and take it apart step by step, then work to reinstate our mindset with this as a principle

We have an **Action Desire** which doesn't correlate with the **Action Potential** for this same action, to make it correlate there are a few things we can modify.

This could be wanting to learn a new language or it could be wanting not to eat sugar (in which case the Action Desire is low and the action potential is high)

- Manipulate perceived value of action
- Manipulate friction of action
- Manipulate perceived value of inverse action
- Manipulate friction of inverse action

## The Action's Attributes
The easiest way we know to "motivate" us is to modify the existing actions attributes. This is the classic approach

### Perceived Value 
We can increase the perceived value of an action by using different actions to increase the **Action Potential**, we can do that by thinking how amazing it would be to preform such action and how many rewards we would reap afterwards, we can promise ourselves things, lie to ourselves, make the value proposition high which in turn makes us more likely to go though.

### Friction (or Perceived Difficulty, Price )
We can reduce friction of the action with other actions by doing some of the process ahead of time, making the situation more clear (when things are unclear or uncertain we tend to avoid taking action = increase friction) or acquiring help from others
