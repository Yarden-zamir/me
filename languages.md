Language is what made humans different from other species. 
Thanks to language, we can communicate and collaborate.
This step in evolution is extremely important for our development. We can warn each other from dangers (as other animals do) which may lead us to think that they are concious on some level.
But more importantly, we can discuss ideas. Such as rescources or how we call it nowadays, money.
This tool of language helps us achieve significant technologies. This is thanks to the fact that we can work in teams and collaborate which leads me to my other theory on networks.

No one person knows how everythings works. No one engineer knows how the phone works in all of its parts.
each one contributes in their own specific field. But no person can build the whole thing on themselves.
it depends on the complexity of the technology. Because one can build a chair on their own but not a car.
note: technology is any tool that facilitates actions.

What is intersting about language is that a person can act and talk differently while using different language.
Is there perhaps a change in the brain while using differnt words? can some words trigger specific brain areas?
Richard Feynman says that when you know how to say 'bird' in different languages you know nothing about the bird.
but I am not sure that this is the case. maybe you train your brain on different patterns [[patterns]] when you speak many langauges. since each one has its structure.
I believe that music, mathematics and spoken languages are all different languages. different ways to pass on ideas.
