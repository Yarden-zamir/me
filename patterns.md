If we have to define intelligence, how would we do it?
I believe that the defenition has to include recognizing patterns quickly.
there must be a pattern recognition and the amount of time which it takes to do it is also crucial. Because if it takes one 10 years to conclude something it takes other people a few minutes, then, even though they reached the conclusion, it took too long.
Therefore, we can also say that intelligence is relative. Relative to other people. Because if there were other intelligent creatures that could develop everything humans did for centuries in just a few minutes then comparing to them we aren't so intelligent.
