Fried onions with mushrooms and ground beef

## ingredients
- 6 to 8 onions
- 2 to 3 mushrooms boxes
- 400g ground beef with 25%+ fat or equivalent amount of fake meat
- salt, pepper, sweet paprica
- bunus: garlic head
- bunus: parsley

## steps
1. Cut onions and half the mushrooms as small as is comfortable for you to cut, the smaller they will be the faster they will carmelize becauase of the larger surface area. You can turn on the heat on high with some oil and throw them as soon as you finish each one.
2. Fry on high heat with olive oil while mixing until brown and or about to burn
3. Lower heat to low/medium and keep mixing periodically for 15 to 60 minutes. 
4. Add the ground beef and mix until it's cooked
5. Add salt, pepper, sweet paprica and mix
6. Add the rest of the mushrooms and mix until they are coated with the beef and onions and serve

## notes
- You can add a head of garlic at the same time as the beef
- You can add parsley at the end
- Dont add water
- You can take the stem of the second batch of mushrooms and toss it with the onions
- Unlike the [[basic veggies and protein daily]] this dish works best with some other dish as focus, I recommend [[Sweetpotato carrot mash with garlic and pecans]]
