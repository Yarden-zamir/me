# Why we stand in escalators, carrots, sticks and  the psychology of progress bars

Escalators are meant to make our lives easier -> stairs, but they move. Makes sense so far. Unlike elevators though, you are not bound when using them, in-fact you can use the stairs same as you always would. One problem though, we don't; at least most / many people don't, instead, when reaching an escalator we stand still. Now, you may say that it makes sense, my goal is to move, if the escelator moves me I don't need to move  but that's absured! You goal is reaching your destination! It always was! Wake up sheeple!

Now, in all seriousness, there is no logical reason to stop walking when reaching an escelator. If you want a break you can stop walking at any point in your path (including on the escelator) and the amount of time and energy used will be the same ()
