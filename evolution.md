Evolution as a concept is a conglomeration of two simple concepts, trial and error and keeping knowledge.

As long as something has those two traits, and the two relay on each-other, I would say it is evolution

If you just know things, that's not evolution. If you just try many things until one works, that's not evolution. Instead, if you do both, try things until one works, then store that information and continue to the next layer, then that would be evolution.

The two concepts can be joint without beeing evolution, for example, a brute force aproach to cracking a password. The computer knows about the possible solutions theoretically, then it attempts (trial and error) each one in turn.
