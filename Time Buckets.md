# Concept
Using existing approaches to budgeting and using money as a [[time management]] approach.  
After using [[YNAB]] for over two years, I really think their bucket based approach is the best for budgeting, I also thing that budgeting could be applied to time in much the same way. 

We split our budget between buckets, from the obvious ones like **sleep**, **eat**, **work** to more abstract things like **alone time**, **social** etc..  
Then when we expand time we note down which bucket was used and we subtract, then it's much easier to let ourselves enjoy some good [[Netflix]] time without feeling guilty, and also gives us a solid point to stop at when we consume too much time on it.
