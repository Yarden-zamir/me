I am sitting  
In the morning  
At the diner  
On the corner
[b0]
I am waiting  
At the counter  
For the man  
To pour the coffee
[b1]
And he fills it  
Only halfway  
And before  
I even argue

He is looking  
Out the window  [b0]
At somebody  
Coming in
[B]
It is always  
Nice to see you  
Says the man  
Behind the counter
[b0]
To the woman  
Who has come in  
She is shaking  
Her umbrella
[b1]
And I look  
The other way  [b0]
As they are kissing  
Their hellos

(and) I'm pretending  
Not to see them  [b1]
(and) Instead  
I pour the milk
[B]
I open  
Up the paper  
There's a story  
Of an actor
[b0]
Who had died  
While he was drinking  
It was no one  
I had heard of
[b1]
And I'm turning  
To the horoscope  [b0]
And looking  
For the funnies
[b1]
When I'm feeling  
Someone watching me  
And so  
I raise my head
[b]
There's a woman  
On the outside  
Looking inside  
Does she see me?
[b]
No she does not  
Really see me  
Cause she sees  
Her own reflection
[b]
And I'm trying  
Not to notice  
That she's hitching  
Up her skirt

And while she's  
Straightening her stockings  
Her hair  
Has gotten wet
[B]
Oh, this rain  
It will continue  
Through the morning  
As I'm listening
[b]
To the bells  
Of the cathedral  
I am thinking  
Of your voice...
[B]
And of the midnight picnic  
Once upon a time  
Before the rain began...
[B]
I finish up my coffee  
It's time to catch the train
