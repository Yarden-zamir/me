The tower is a role playing game setting set in a late magic-induced industrial revolution where humanity lives in a bio-mechanical tower that strives to take care of all their needs.

In a fantasy world where research and science were propelled upwards by the discovery of “magical” casting, humans toiled on the solution to all their problems. Welcome to the tower. The living and breathing heart of mankind, the only world that matters. People, cities, ideas and empires rise and fall within the depths of the tower. And yet its dream lives on. Protection, production, food, water, systems, all provided. No more divide! One language, one ideal. Progress, forwards and upwards.

At a time when humanity was mired by wars, hunger and disease. A royal surgeon named Kan discovered something remarkable. He, discovered the magical and fantastical power of casting.

Over the span of the next 20 years, developments skyrocketed, science, technology, construction, research. No field was left untouched, casting has made the world - a better place, as Kan put it. 

He created an order called the open tower, which consolidated and shared knowledge.

But nothing comes without it’s due cost, and so with the advent and advance of technology, humanity polluted the land, and with the progress of casting, humanity inadvertently paved the way to mutes, a virus that makes humans and animals alike change their essence, over the span of lives instead of generations, usually with destructive results.

Humanity pained the land, and the land pushed back. Cities destroyed, villages burned, roads made unsafe and the war ridden nature of the land came back with a twisted smile.

Humanity did not relent, many of the world greatest minds banded together and constructed humanity's greatest production, the tower. Engineers, casters, generals, kings, whole cities flocked to the tower and together they created a building, a machine, some say, a creature, that will be the salvation of humanity, a way for humanity to survive, but also, reach for the heavens.

And reach for the heavens they did.

But what happens, when the heavens reach back?
