The tower is a role playing game setting set in a late magic-induced industrial revolution where humanity lives in a bio-mechanical tower that strives to take care of all their needs.

In a fantasy world where research and science were propelled upwards by the discovery of “magical” casting, humans toiled on the solution to all their problems. Welcome to the tower. The living and breathing heart of mankind, the only world that matters. People, cities, ideas and empires rise and fall within the depths of the tower. And yet its dream lives on. Protection, production, food, water, systems, all provided. No more divide! One language, one ideal. Progress, forwards and upwards.
