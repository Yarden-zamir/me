Hi, I'm a software engineer at Qlik, I like automation, philosophy, people, games and writing. 

Here's a few **I**s ðŸ‘‡
- I want to be in the timeline where open source is the future of tech/politics/schooling/maybe everything? A bit naive but I'm sticking to it.
- I am very organized in many domains only because I am naturally so messy
- I like tools and systems more than I like what they solve
- I don't like working hard
- I will work very hard because of the above mentioned line
- I am often vain, many times a hypocrite and sometimes -
- I branch off very easily and often, creating a beautiful tree and many unfinished branches
- I like pipes
