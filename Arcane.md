The show is "crunchy", really well animated, really good sound, written pretty well and is overall awesome. 

Really amazing, above and beyond amazing, every character is gold, story and development is top notch, crazy good animation. An incredible piece of art, truly.
  
Watching episode 4 (batch 2) and they are celebrating: progress day, which sounds like an interesting idea #seeds/worldbuilding 

Fuck, gotta say, this show is the best
