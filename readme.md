# What Are You Doing Yarden?
I always wanted to write more than just to myself, this is my attempt to do so, by making my writing [[Public by default]] thus making the friction point on the **hiding** action instead of on the **sharing** and increasing the [[Action Potential model|Action Potential]] of my desired goal

# Half Baked
The nature of [[Public by default]] means that most of the "content" here is unpolished ideas and tangents, that's alright

# Some Random Links to Start Exploring
Get a feel for what I want this sandbox to be like  
[[The Sovereign Mind]]  
[[Shower Thought - how can we capitalize]]  
[[I bought winrar]]  
[[A reeds tale ]]  
[[Digital Mindfield Manifest]]  

# Open Source tho??
I think it would be cool to think, if already in a public way, also in an open one. Anyone can "fork my mind" or change it with a pull request, I really like that idea. Anyone can raise issues with my thinking (or with me in general I guess, that would funny)

# Ok, but How?
