# Um.. Who is Yarden?
> [[Yarden Zamir|Yarden]]

# What Are You Doing Yarden? What is This Place?
I have always wanted to write more than just for myself. This is my attempt to do so by making my writing [[Public by default]], thus putting the friction point on hiding rather than sharing and increasing the [[Action Potential Model|Action Potential]] of my desired goal

# Half Baked
The nature of [[Public by default]] means that most of the "content" here is unpolished ideas and tangents, that's alright

# Some Random Links to Start Exploring
Get a feel for what I want this sandbox to feel like  
[[Action Potential Model]]  
[[Shower Thought How can we capitalize]]  
[[I bought winrar]]  
[[A reeds tale]]  
[[Digital Mindfield Manifest]]  
[[eating tomatoes|Yarden defeating his biggest enemy]]  
[[Branch based writing]]

# Open Source though??
I think it would be cool to think, if already in a public way, also in an open one. Anyone can "fork my mind"or change it with a pull request, I really like that idea. Anyone can raise issues with my thinking (or with me in general I guess, that would funny)

# Ok, but How?
Using [obsidian-zola-plus](https://github.com/Yarden-zmr/obsidian-zola-plus) which is my fork of [rockmanvnx6's fork](https://github.com/rockmanvnx6/obsidian-zola) of [obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola) which uses Zola, [elasticlunr](http://weixsong.github.io) and Obsidian-export. I use github for content and history, netlify for hosting, giscuss for comments and some python scripts for content manipulation

# What is in Here?
Ideas, thoughts, write-ups, brainstorming  

# What is Not in Here?
Journals, people notes, other stuff I'm not brave enough to share yet
