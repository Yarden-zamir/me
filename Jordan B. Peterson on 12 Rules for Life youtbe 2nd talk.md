>this woman comes up to a psychiatrist I think this is in this chapter and she says you know I'm having a really rough time of it I'm suffering badly my life is not going well and and then she says **I hope that there's something wrong with me** and the psychiatrist she says well here's how I look at it there's either something wrong with the world and I'm just in it and that's how it is and then like what am I going to do about that because it's **the whole world or maybe I could be fortunate and there's something wrong with me** that's causing all this unnecessary suffering and if I could just** set it right I could learn and I could set it right
