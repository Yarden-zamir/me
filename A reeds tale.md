Stay a while and listen to a short, snappy, and morrally questionable tale of a lonely reed, a cane out of sync, a good friend to not but no one. Would you like some sugar? He would ask the frog. The frog would know he tells no truth and leave. Would you come and reed? He asks the princess. He kept on by as words she well knew. Slowly approaching he asked the old man, would you like a friend? And so, they left together, the old man and his cane.
