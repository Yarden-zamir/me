At first when watching the video I was struck by how well she put together her words and how succinct her sentence composition was. Then the second thing I noticed was that I didn't find her points interesting and decided [[Savannah Brown|she]] is not deep or interesting. This is the interesting part, because, I believe I felt [[Fear|threatened]] by her for some reason, pushing me to convince myself that she was not special or, more importently, not more special than me.

required action:: I need to identify this feeling of [[Fear]] and make sure that when I encounter this sort of thing I think twice before proceeding, I think this should be something I can manage.
