# The Move to linux
#dates/2022/12/22
It's happening, after some extensive research and some leaps of trust in future self, I decided to go with endavoros and KDE plasma. I know this is not the best choice to start with linux, usually you would want something more gradual and an almost pure Arch distro is not that, but the tinkering around and the problem solving part sounds so fun, and that's what people mostly complain about right? So I should be in safe territory, solving problems is my comfort zone.

Here goes nothing. Goodbye windows!

# First day of using linux
So the transition went well. The only thing that differed from expectation was how finiky, none-responsive and generally unintuitive KDE-plasma was, even for the extra customisability it's not worth it. Tried Gnome and it's generally a much better experiance, (although barely any settings wtf)

Most of my zsh toolkit from mac worked as is, made some slight changes to make the scripts more universal

Funnely enough I didn't find a good terminal emulator. Linux, the land of the terminal doesn't have a feature rich terminal emulator that works. There is nothing close to Iterm2 or warp. For now i'm making do with a basic gnome one but I definitely need to figure out a solution for this
