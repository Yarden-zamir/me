[[Linux]] is made for people like me, there is literally no good enough reason for me to prostpone it anymore, I can play all of my games thanks to [[Steam]] 

#### Pros
- I will learn a lot
- Continuity with my [[Mac]] at [[Job/Software Engineer at Qlik|Work]]
- Customization!
- Moral superiority
- Supporting open source
- Not supporting [[Microsoft]]
- Cool points
- More customization, I fucking love customization, shit..
