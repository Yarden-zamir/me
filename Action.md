Taking small steps is trivial but crucial.
in order to do, if we think too big we get lost and don't know where to start.
we need to define goals (even if outragous) and define small actions in order to get there. Otherwise, we get lost in the process and might ditch the whole project.
Only if we start small, it can be easier and more sustainable.

For example, in the climbing gym the different routes are catagorized by difficulty. V0 is easiest, then V1, v2 and so forth.
Then as an athlete it is easier to improve when you know your level and you can play within your abilities without getting to discouraged if you're not good enough or if it is not challenging enough.
This game is not only in sports but in games in general, in life. We need to find the balance between challenge in disappointment.
Many video games are built on this principle.
