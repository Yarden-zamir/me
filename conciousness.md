On the theory of being conciousness.
Later on I will publish more reading material, mostly Roger penrose's.
For now, this is my philoshophy on conciousness. I believe that there are different level of being concious. 
For example, monkeys are somewhat conscious creatures. But most would argue that they aren't human like.
I would argue that certain humans are more concious than others. Moreover, some connect because they signal on the same frequency.
