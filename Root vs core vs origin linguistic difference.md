Some thoughts the words root, core, origin

A root of a tree is what provides it with nourishment it is at the base of the tree and it grows with it over time providing more and more resources. All that being taken into account, we miss out on a lot of the value in the word by using it to mean origin or core more often than not and neglecting the side of it that takes growth into account

Root common uses
- The cause of something
Core 
Origin
- The beginning of something
- The cause of something
