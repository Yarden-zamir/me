Legend tells of a powerful magical mix of nuts and spices that can unlock the gates to the highest peaks and the lowest shores. It is said that while it may induce a slight affect of hat related forgetfulness, the price is well worth the power it brings forth. If, dear reader, you are brave enough to mix and spice and roast said nuts, please, read on..

- Nuts
  - Almonds
  - Cashews
  - Pecans
  - Coconut
- Spices
  - Salt
  - Paprika
  - Cinnamon
  - Pepper
- Oil
  - Olive oil
  - OR butter, but be very careful! If burned the whole batch is ruined
# Optional Addons
- very little maple syrup - adds a little sweetness, same with butter, it can burn
- Chilli flakes - adds a little heat, don't add too much

# Steps
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
2. Mix nuts, spices and oil in a bowl, use a good amount of oil, it soaks into the nuts well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed
3. Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet, as evenly as possible
4. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, watch closely to make sure they don't burn, they can burn easily
5. Let cool for a few minutes, texture is off when hot
