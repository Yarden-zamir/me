## Comment:
Really amazing, above and beyond amazing, every character is gold, story and development is top notch, crazy good animation. An incredible piece of art, truly.
	
Watching episode 4 (batch 2) and they are celebrating: progress day, which sounds like an interesting idea #seeds/worldbuilding 

Fuck, gotta say, this show is the best
