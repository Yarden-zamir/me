I [[feeling]] I must explore more. I feel as though there are many things that I block myself from experiencing properly because of that feeling. Specifically with its regard to people.

I think that when it comes to physical elements, I will be able to overcome fear, then with ideas it will be more difficult, finding myself needing to build logic before taking action, then the hardest part is with people, feeling that someone is better than me drives me to action (or inaction) in a way I don't very much appreciate.

A good example of the last point is the [[Youtube]] video ![[if i'm you and you're me then...who's that]]
