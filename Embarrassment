Is there aything inherently embarrassing? 
Is there an evolutionary reason for this feeling? 
I believe it is dependent on the person or group of people who this feeling is associated with.
As kids, nothing was embarrassing. I think it is just something that we develope growing up. Therefore, there is nothing that is really emarrassing but what society decides what is embarrassing.
We can choose what is embarrassing for us. We can talk to the people around us and cancel this feeling out.
If we can do that, is anything truely embarrassing? 
This theory is incomplete, because I'm sure we all have this feeling at some degree. Then why is that.
