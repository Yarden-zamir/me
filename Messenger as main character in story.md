In battle, delivering orders to squads on the battlefield until one day realizes that the orders are bad, starting to deliver alternative orders and the army starts to win

Turning point
The sun burned hot against the ashen sky as Cale sprinted across the uneven terrain. Dirt clouding behind him as his boots repeatedly reintroduce themselves to the dry earth. The hot smell of gunpowder sharp in his nostrils as he clutched the tightly rolled parchment in one hand, the wax seal already melting under the heat of his palm and the rapidly increasing solar glare. He didn’t need to open it; he knew the orders by heart before the ink was dry. "Advance to the ridge. Hold position until reinforcements arrive." 

Familiar as an old friend, the words that direct death. Cale did not mind such a thing as a principle, they are fighting to win, killing is part of the game, but some words lead to our death, or rather theirs he corrected himself, I am not one of them. He could see his mothers eys stearing dagers into him, penertating deeply withoyut saying a word, until he uttered those few simple words. I am not one of them. 

"Runner!" The shout shoke him off of his revere as he steered himself passed the small guarding force at the back and onto the southern slope. "Runner!" He repeated the shout himself this time, lifting up the hand caring the parchment as if it were the marker of a thousand suns.

Cale has delivered hundrads of those orders, to each front and each squad, he was faster than all of them, and they knew it. Delivering commanmds issued by men sitting in tens miles from the screeching chaos of the battlefield, far from the frontline. He had learned not to linger, not to look back, even thoguh he always did, always read the reports on what happens after he's done his job, after the orders were given. 

But this.. The ridge was a death trap. Cale had seen the enemy’s cannons swivel toward it hours ago, their barrels poised like hungry wolves waiting for prey. To hold the ridge was to court annihilation. The information was all there yet the orders stayed the same.  

He reached Captain Harlan’s squad, crouched behind a crumbled stone wall, their faces smeared with soot and exhaustion. Harlan, a stocky man with a perpetually furrowed brow, looked up as Cale approached, his expression a mix of hope and dread. Almost knowing what Cale was going to say before he even spoke, Harlan raised his hand and waved for the boy to approach

“What’s the word?” Harlan's bark did not echo so much as it resonated through the close by reaches of the battlefield as the surrounding soildiers's attention shifted promptly to the sound of the shout. Almost as if it was adressed to them. In a way it was, Cale realized, his words, the words coming out of his mouth, are going to decide wether these men live or die today, wether they ever see their families or not. Well not his words really, he is just the messanger,

Cale hesitated. For a moment, he saw it all in his mind’s eye: the squad breaking cover, sprinting up the ridge, the enemy cannons thundering to life. Harlan and his men wouldn’t last five minutes.

The parchment seemed to burn in his hand.

“Cale!” Harlan snapped. “The orders, boy!”

The words formed in his mind before he’d even decided to say them. "Move to the hollow to the east" he said, holding out the parchment as if it confirmed his lie. "The officers say it will provide better cover for a counter attack" he added, his voice rising in pitch as he spoke. Harlan’s brow furrowed as he took the parchment. "Counter attack?" he asked, his voice low. "Yes, sir. Cale stepped forward almost evenly, trying to surpress his exhaustion from the run up, and, hesitating only a little, he drew the map from the other side of the table, half eying the commander as he did so.
He cleared his throat. "The enemy lines consist of a cannon battery and a mixed infantry platoon" he said, tapping two close points on the map. "Because of the recent skirmish in the Redwoods" Another tap "They undoubtedly have had to send reinforcements from the ridge, and they were able to do so, because.." He trailed off, realizing he was about to say something that the commander may not like. "Because of the.. situation here. The conflict was short but long enough that they would refill the empty spot on the ridge before too long, and that's where the river line comes in. They have their central logistics there, and spare units" His hand hovered over the river where it parted with the nearby valley. The commander eyed him, then nodded slowly, a thinking look on his face as he fingered his chin. "In that case they would fill the ranks in the ridge with fresh units from the river line, and those would not only be fresh, they would be green" He looked straight at Cale as he finished his sentence. "Which may not be a big deal when maintaining their line, but it will be when faced with a full on counter attack" He paused, his expression growing more serious. 
Cale noticed the almost eery quite around the tent, when he arrived a the cacophony of soldiers, cooks, games, arguments, weapons was as intense as they come. But now, the camp around them seemed more muted. The soldiers did not know what was being said, but they did know that whatever it was, it will be what ultimately decided whether they ever get to see their families again.
