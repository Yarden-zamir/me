The definition for [[evolution]] in [[Wikipedia]]
> **Evolution** is change in the [heritable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity "Heredity") [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait "Phenotypic trait") of biological [populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population "Population") over successive generations.

Which is a pretty good initial definition, aside from one element, the biological element, I see evolution as the concept of successive changes in traits towards a vast array of problem domains over iterations, the problem domains, ie requirements, may not stay the same between iterations and iterations may not be rigidly defined. 

I may define evolution in an even more distilled manor, evolution is trial and error. Simple, yet sufficient for this thought experiment

Now, in the development of Humanity, there are a few elements that relay on evolution, the simplest one would be genetic evolution, where each iteration is a "trial" for a set of genes based on the last with slight changes. Then there is social evultion, an evolution of ideas that are meant to better humanity 
It's important for us to understand the destination between the evolution of the human species in terms of genes and the evolution of the human socity
