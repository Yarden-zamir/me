live dangerously
The will to power as a way of looking at our human nautre.
we desire power and shouldn't resist our nature.
only those who climb the mountain and go through all the pain will get to see the view.
Living life to its fullest gratification.
Pain is the way to happiness. we need to embrace pain.
