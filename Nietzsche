Live dangerously

The will to power as a way of looking at our human nautre.
we desire power and shouldn't resist our nature.

only those who climb the mountain and go through all the pain will get to see the view.

Living life to its fullest gratification.

Pain is the way to happiness. we need to embrace pain.

Control your circumstances. Do not surrnder to how powerless you are, but rather work tirelessly.

risk yout life in order to get the things you want out of this world

Be a master of your own desert. (as in a game, build the things you decide are "meaningful)

Set goals. Reach them, then set new ones.

The Overman- there is always a room for growth. Embrace the fact that we will never arrive at a destination in our lives when it comes to our development.
Great satisfaction of life, the ones who are truely happy are the ones who do great things. Who strive to get better, who dream big. The happiness of the ones that are in their comfort zone is limited, it is the view from the top of the boulder vs from the top of the mountain.
