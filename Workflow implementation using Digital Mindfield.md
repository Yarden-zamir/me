This is my implementation of [[Digital Mindfield Manifest]]
# [[Digital Mindfield Manifest#Processing canvas|Processing canvas]]
I will be using [[Obsidian.md]] to fill this role as it is reliable, fast, easy to use and is entirely* under my control.

# File structure hierarchy and organization 
### Files
Files are storage for information captured, annotated, fabricated, or otherwise relevant to you and to their corresponding context (folder)
- All information should relate to you, the idea is not to capture objective concepts, as that is already done by [[Wikipedia]] but instead capture and fabricate information of your own using external sources.
	- Examples:
		- When learning capture external information such as formulas and rules only in relation to active learning. The job of collecting useful external tools should be delegated away from your [[#Processing canvas]] and into a [[#Launcher]] of sorts
### Tags
Tags play the role of **collections** or **types**
	- A new [idea] can be of the collection [seeds] but is not bound to a specific context (folder) and instead can be found anywhere around the vault
		- This as opposed to a [dirt] which would not work when taken out of the context of [Minecraft] for example
### Folders
Folders play the role of contexts
	- A new entry can be valuable and meaningful only in specific context, one can specify context in file name, or instead place said entry in a folder structure that describes context so that to group context groups together
		- I can have [Axe], [Sword], [Shovel] in root, which  would mean that I describes those concept's relation and significance to me or in [Minecraft] which would describe those concepts as relate to minecraft and also to me (in that order).
		- I can have [Minecraft Axe] or [Minecraft/Axe], both of those are valid entries.
			- It would usually be preferable is more than one entry exsists in a given context to use the later (folder) ie, explicitly define context
	- It is desirable to not create context when none is needed, most entries should be describable in root with the context of how they relate to you
