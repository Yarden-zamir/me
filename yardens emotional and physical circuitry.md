I'm good at giving myself what I want, my sensitivity to my inner self is very high. Many times there is good correlation between what I want and what I need, like with food, with phisical movement, phisical touch and closeness (most things phsical are synced) but when it comes to my emotional needs it's more disconnected, meaning the stuff that I need emotionally do not translate directly to want, and because my want is my biggest drive to action, I don't act / don't know how to act in favor of my emotional needs. This is why I'm looking for solidity in others, I'm looking for someone to be able to translate my emotional needs to in a way I cannot myself

the echo chamber - I am very good at holding and giving space, I really am, and I can be there for a person, especially and specifically a person I love very much. A lot. The problem is that, and that one is a bit complicated, I cannot give space to reactions of me needing space. Ie, if I need space and you can't give it (which brings a reaction that in itself needs space) I will not be able to hold that at all (or as much)

solidity - at a basic level I want someone who i can relay on when I need, a translation of that is that I want the process of realying on someonee when a need arises to be possible.
