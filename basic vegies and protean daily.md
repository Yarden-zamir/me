# Core
- 400g to 1k (depending on their density) of veggies easily aquired as frozen bags you can get really cheaply
- protean, either...
  - 300g to 400g of tofu
    - 13% protean at least, some packages have less (meaning more water) so don't buy those
  - 350 to 450g of ground beef
    - 14% to 20% protean depends on fat content
    - prefer 25% to 35% fat
  - 2 to 3 cans of tuna
    - 25% protean (after removing water content)
    - get the ones with water as the ones with oil come with cheap vegtible oil that's pretty bad, or olive oil that's expensive.
      - drain the water and compensate with the olive oil 
- a generous amount of olive oil
  - less if went with meat
- spices
  - sweet paprica 
    - around 1 to 4 spoons
    - not the spicy one even if you like spicy food, add spicy though other means, sweet paprica has very specific personality and spicy one has less of that
  - curry 
    - 0.4 to 1 big spoons
    - get the big containers they will last you a while
    - if going with mae ploy, i find that the green and red are good but the yellow has less presense (but is still spicy)
    - usually has a lot of salt so put less salt the more curry you add
# Addons
- onions 
  - around 1 to 69 onions is best
  - fry them as long as you have patience for
  - the smaller you cut them the faster they carmelize but the less onion texture you have (a good tradeoff usually)
- carrots / sweet potatoes / even potatoes (although less tasty if added at the end)
  - cheap and easy to wash and cut so they are a great addition
  - can be added at the beginig and add sweetness to the dish
  - can be added at the end ot add crunchy awesomeness to the dish
  - if you wash them well you don't need to peel them
- green apple
  - add at the very end to create an awesomne contrast with the spicy/salty to the sweet/sour. Trust me, it works 
- coconut cream
  - add a much welcomed creameness and helps bind the dish together
  - I like to let it steam a bit of it's water content out to make it a tad more viscus 
  - at least 20% fat
  - you can get 250ml box per meal
- penut butter
  - the natural one
  - one spoon is enough, usually, unless you want it to take over
- parsley
  - if you have the time, a head of parsly brings this dish to new levels
