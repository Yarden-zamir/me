In [[Obsidian.md]] and many other tools there is graph view which is a a way to view all your notes and their connections. This view is very cool and useful when your vault is small, but when the vault becomes huge, it becomes useless, or at least that's what people say, I disagree.

To start, I do agree that the use of general view is indeed no longer useful, but the problem here is that people don't really take into account the other elements of using the graph

### Local Graph
The local graph, ie minimap shows current connections for the current note
